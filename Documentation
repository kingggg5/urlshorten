# Project Structure

## Server-Side

### Controller
- Handles API requests for URL shortening, redirection, and fetching all URLs.

### Model
- Mongoose schema for storing URLs and click counts.

### API
- API route for handling redirection by key.
- API route for URL shortening (POST `/api/url`), redirection (GET `/api/:key`), and fetching all URLs (GET `/api/urls`).

### Service
- Service layer for database operations related to URLs.

### Scripts
- Scripts for seeding or testing the database.

### Utils
- Utility function to connect to MongoDB.

### Tests
- Unit tests for the URL service.

## Client-Side

### Component
- Manages the user interface and interaction, including forms, tables, and error messages.

### API Client
- Processes the server responses and updates the UI accordingly.

### Utils
- Provides helper functions for the client-side code.

### Server-Side Rendering
- Fetches data on the server before rendering the page.

## Scalability Concerns and Resolutions

### 1. Database Performance with High Volume of Data

**Problem:**  
As the number of URLs grows, database operations like fetching or creating new URLs may slow down, particularly when there are frequent read and write operations, such as URL clicks.

**Solution:**
- **Indexes:** Index the key field in MongoDB to speed up lookups. Indexing helps improve search performance significantly.
- **Sharding MongoDB:** For larger datasets, sharding the MongoDB database can distribute data across multiple servers, improving performance.
- **Caching:** Use caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached to store frequently requested URLs, reducing the load on the database and speeding up responses.

### 2. Concurrency and Race Conditions

**Problem:**  
When multiple users click the same link simultaneously, race conditions may occur, leading to incorrect click counts.

**Solution:**  
- **Atomic Updates:** Use MongoDBâ€™s `$inc` operator, which ensures atomic increments to the click count, preventing race conditions even with concurrent requests.

### 3. Scalability of API Requests

**Problem:**  
High traffic on the API, especially for URL redirection or creation, can become a bottleneck if requests aren't handled efficiently.

**Solution:**
- **Load Balancing:** Implement a load balancer like Nginx or AWS Elastic Load Balancing to evenly distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale the application horizontally by deploying it across multiple servers. Use containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage and scale the application effectively.

### 4. User Interface Performance

**Problem:**  
Displaying a large number of shortened URLs on the frontend may slow down page load times and affect user experience.

**Solution:**
- **Pagination:** Introduce pagination in the frontend to load only a limited number of URLs at a time, reducing the data being rendered at once.
- **Client-Side Caching:** Use tools like React Query or SWR to cache data on the client side and reduce redundant network requests, improving overall performance.
